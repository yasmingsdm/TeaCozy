# TeaCozy 

This project is a Code Academy project where I created a fictional tea shop website on my own computer.

I used HTML and CSS.

What I've practiced/learned:
Following a design spec to create the website - You can check the design spec [here](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-4/img-tea-cozy-redline.jpg?_gl=1*14heg06*_ga*NTEzNzQzNDM5OS4xNjY4MTYyMTI4*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L*MTY2OTc5Njc3NC4yOS4xLjE2Njk3OTY3NzYuMC4wLjA.);
Anchor to the same page (HTML);
Flexbox (CSS);
Grid (CSS);
Background-image (CSS).
