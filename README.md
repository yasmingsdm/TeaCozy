This project is a Code Academy project where I created a fictional tea shop website on my own computer.

Anchor to the same page (HTML);
Responsive design (CSS);
Hover effects(CSS);
Switch (JavaScript);
Refresh the page (JavaScript);
Arrays (JavaScript);
Adding a collaborator (GitHub);
Requesting code review (GitHub).
